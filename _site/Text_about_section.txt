Passionate about the potential of bioinformatics to positively impact healthcare outcomes for patients, I am a multidisciplinary scientist with expertise spanning biophysics, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence. My academic journey includes a Physics Engineering degree with a specialization in biophysics, a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering focused on bioinformatics and omics data analysis, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science specializing in structural bioinformatics and machine learning. My professional experience spans multiple roles, including a Research Engineer position at CNRS where I developed expertise in data visualization and programming through the development of a molecular dynamics visualization interface. As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Lorraine, I delivered courses in data structures and big data. Earlier in my career, as International Academic Affairs Coordinator, I developed strong team management and negotiation skills. Currently, I am seeking new professional challenges where I can leverage my expertise in bioinformatics and data science to make meaningful contributions to healthcare innovation and patient well-being.
